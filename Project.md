# How is it like working at the Big Tech Companies?

I will try to analyse how it is like to working in one of the biggest tech companies available. My main motivation is that soon I will be job searching and I want to know what I should expect, main positives and negatives of tech companies, etc... And what better than to compare to the biggest ones.

*Possible focus points*
* What is the best location to work in?
* Where should I work if I want to be in the nearest possible location from Barcelona?
* Where should I go if I just want money?
* What words are most commonly used per each company review? (Possible word cloud usage?)
* Best company to work in by country? Best country to work in by company?
* Is the a correlation between a long "bad" review and a bad score? Is shorter bad reviews correlated to good scores?
* And what about the "good" reviews length? Does it affect scores?
* Do a matrix correlation to find possible correlations between the different scoring. EX: High compensatoin -> Low Work/Balance?
