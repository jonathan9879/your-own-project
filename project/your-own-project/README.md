# Welcome to Your Own Project!

## Project Goals
* Do the e2e analysis by your own.
* Give some insights about a topic of your choice giving some arguments by:
  * Being able to transmit the analysis in an ordered way.
  * Using the statistical techniques learnt during the last weeks.
  * Plotting the graphs in a useful way for the reader / listener. Yes, no additional rules Jordi.
* Present your analysis in two ways and for two different audiencies:
  * Technical audience: you will present a paper.
  * Non tech audience: you will do a short presentation.


## Deliverables
* A notebook with your analysis in a paper way. Jupyter or Zeppelin are allowed.
* A 3' presentation in the auditorium.
* Repository with your workflow + documentation + code. Even if you are working alone, you need to keep good practices!

## The presentation
* In the auditorium.
* 3 minutes talk, 2 minutes questions. No more. Yeah, exactly.
* The audience will evaluate their understanding on your presentation (this will help you in further presentations).

## General schedule
*Today*
* Think on a topic and propose some questions. 
* Choose the data interesting. 
* Look for documentation to give context to your project.
* Write the README file in your repository.

*Tuesday*
* Teachers validation --NO CODE UNTIL HERE--

*Tuesday-Wednesday*
* Start importing the data and cleaning it.
* Start the analysis. Remember all the techniques you have learnt.
* Prepare a draft of your first slides presentation (no analysis or conclusions yet): title, motivation, context, ...

*Thursday*
* First rehearshall. Take the feedback and use it!

*Thursday - Next Tuesday*
* Finish the analysis. Finish the slides.

*Tuesday*
* General rehearshall.

*Tuesday - Wednesday*
* Last improvements.

*Wednesday*
* Presentation!

## General advices
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!).
* Ask for help vs Google is your friend.
* Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you ;)
* Documentate yourself. Know about the problem. Look for some analysis that someone did before you.
* You *can* use the projects your partners did in the last week. You can't use your own project.
* Before doing a graph, think what you want to represent.
